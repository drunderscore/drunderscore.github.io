Hi! I am resin. My name is James Puleo.

## Programming
I've been programming for over 10 years. I've been known to use:
- C++
- Zig
- C#
- Java
- JavaScript

I create cool software and try to write great code. I'm most interested in reverse engineering and networking stacks.

## Livestream Production
### Team Fortress 2
I am the owner of [Fireside Casts](https://firesidecasts.tv), currently leading broadcast as well as development.

Fireside Casts is a livestream broadcast organization that watches and hosts competitive Team Fortress 2 matches, tournaments, and events.

In the past and occasional present, I've worked with and produced for:
- [EssentialsTF](https://essentials.tf)
- [teamfortress.tv](https://teamfortress.tv)
- [RESUP.GG](https://resup.gg)
- [KritzKast](https://twitch.tv/kritzkast)
- [CappingTV](https://cappingtv.com)
- [Seasonalander](https://twitch.tv/seasonalander)
- [Fortress Faceoffs](https://www.twitch.tv/fortressfaceoffs)

I've developed software and tooling specially-made to aid in the observation and broadcast of TF2:
- Flask, a client plugin that exposes gamestate information
- The CappingTV webHUD, powered by Flask
- The Fireside Casts webHUD, powered by Flask
