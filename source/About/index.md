Hi! My name is `James`. You may know me under the alias `Dr. Underscore`.

## Programming
I've been programming for over 10 years. I've been known to use:
- Java
- C#
- C++
- Zig

My intersets usually lie within reverse engineering and network protocol investigations. Who wouldn't want to save a wonderful multiplayer game from death?

I'm an organization member of [Pryaxis](https://github.com/Pryaxis/), a group of developers who create open-source software such as [TShock](https://github.com/Pryaxis/TShock) for Terraria.

I spend a good amount of time contributing to open-source software. You can [check out my GitHub](https://github.com/drunderscore) to see what I've done recently.

## Livestream Production
### Team Fortress 2
I am the Lead Producer and Lead Developer for [Fireside Casts](https://firesidecasts.tv) -- this is my home.
In the past and occasional present, I've worked with and produced for:
- [EssentialsTF](https://essentials.tf)
- [teamfortress.tv](https://teamfortress.tv)
- [RESUP.GG](https://resup.gg)
- [KritzKast](https://twitch.tv/kritzkast)
- [CappingTV](https://cappingtv.com)
- [Seasonalander](https://twitch.tv/seasonalander)
- [Fortress Faceoffs](https://www.twitch.tv/fortressfaceoffs/)

I've developed software and tooling specially-made to aid in the observation and broadcast of TF2:
- Flask, a client plugin that exposes gamestate information
- The CappingTV webHUD, powered by Flask
- The Fireside Casts webHUD, powered by Flask
